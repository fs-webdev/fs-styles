 * Paragraphs
 *
 * ##### Avoid
 *
 * Do not use any font size smaller than the standard paragraph size for any text (other
 * than captions and labels).
 *
 * ##### Accessibility
 *
 * When possible, place the distinguishing information of a paragraph in the first
 * sentence to help improve the scannability of content for all users.

 * @example
 * <p>A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, "to write beside" or "written beside") is a
 * self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea.
 * A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any
 * language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize
 * longer prose.</p>
